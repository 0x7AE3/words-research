The root directory contains some scripts simulating the [Steinhaus problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-gap_theorem) as a `tkinter` animation

[visualizations](visualizations) contains some Sage scripts generating images empirically confirming some well-known facts and some open conjectures

[berthe_kim_construction.py](berthe_kim_construction.py) is separate and implements Lemma 2.1 from [a paper by Berth√© and Kim](https://www.irif.fr/~berthe/Articles/generalization_3_gap.pdf) for computing the data (specifically, the order the points appear on the circle when represented by the integers realizing them) associated with a three gap simulation

these scripts were used (helped) in empirically discovering the [symmetry theorem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00029890.2022.2158021)
